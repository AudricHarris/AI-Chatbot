    "user": "Explain how solar panels work",
    "bot": "Solar panels work by capturing sunlight with photovoltaic cells made of silicon layers. When sunlight hits these cells, it knocks electrons loose, creating an electric current. This process, called the photovoltaic effect, converts solar energy directly into electricity. The panels' DC electricity is then converted to AC by an inverter for home use. Modern solar panels can convert 15-22% of sunlight into usable electricity, helping reduce dependence on fossil fuels."
